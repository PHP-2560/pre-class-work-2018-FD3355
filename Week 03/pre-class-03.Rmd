### Getting Started


We will work with the dataset called [gapminder](https://github.com/jennybc/gapminder), this is a cleaned up version from [Gapminder Data](http://www.gapminder.org/data/). Gapminder contains a lot of great data on all of the nations of the world. We first need to install the gapminder package in R. 

```{R}
#install.packages("gapminder")
```



```{R}
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
#gapminder
```



### Pre-Class Problems

Use **dplyr** functions to address the following questions:

1. How many unique countries are represented per continent?
```{R}
gapminder %>%
distinct(country) %>% #Remove duplicates
count() # Get the number of rows
```
2. Which European nation had the lowest GDP per capita in 1997? 

```{R}
gap_arranged <- gapminder %>%
filter(continent == "Europe") %>% #Select European countries only
arrange(gdpPercap) # From smallest to largest sort by gdpPercap

gap_arranged[1,1] #Pull the name of the country on top of the data set, becasue of our arrange this is the country with the lowest GDP
```
3. According to the data available, what was the average life expectancy across each continent in the 1980s?
```{R}
gapminder %>%
group_by(continent) %>%
summarize(mean(lifeExp))
```
4. What 5 countries have the highest total GDP over all years combined?
```{R}
gapminder %>%
group_by(country) %>%
summarize(GDPMAX=sum(gdpPercap)) %>%
arrange(desc(GDPMAX))  %>%
top_n(5)
```
5. What countries and years had life expectancies of _at least_ 80 years? _N.b. only output the columns of interest: country, life expectancy and year (in that order)._
```{R}
GreatherThen80 = gapminder %>%
select(country,lifeExp,year) %>%
filter(lifeExp>80) %>%
arrange(desc(lifeExp))

print(GreatherThen80, n = 21)
```
6. What 10 countries have the strongest correlation (in either direction) between life expectancy and per capita GDP?
```{R}
gapminder %>%
group_by(country) %>%
summarize(corr=abs(cor(gdpPercap,lifeExp)))  %>%
arrange(corr)  %>%
top_n(10)
```
7. Which combinations of continent (besides Asia) and year have the highest average population across all countries? _N.b. your output should include all results sorted by highest average population_. With what you already know, this one may stump you. See [this Q&A](http://stackoverflow.com/q/27207963/654296) for how to `ungroup` before `arrange`ing. This also [behaves differently in more recent versions of dplyr](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/releases/tag/v0.5.0).

```{R}
gapminder %>%
group_by(continent, year) %>%
filter(continent != "Asia") %>%
summarize(AvgPOP=mean(pop)) %>%
ungroup() %>%
select(continent,year,AvgPOP) %>%
arrange(desc(AvgPOP))
```

8. Which three countries have had the most consistent population estimates (i.e. lowest standard deviation) across the years of available data? 

```{R}
gapminder %>%
group_by(country) %>%
summarize(SD_POP=sd(pop)) %>%
arrange(SD_POP) %>%
top_n(3)
```

9. Subset **gm** to only include observations from 1992 and store the results as **gm1992**. What kind of object is this?
10. Which observations indicate that the population of a country has *decreased* from the previous year **and** the life expectancy has *increased* from the previous year? See [the vignette on window functions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/window-functions.html).
